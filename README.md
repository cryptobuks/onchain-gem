onchain-gem
===========

The onchain gem gives you access to the very basic blockchain data you need to run web wallets and other Bitcoin applications.

The onchain gem actually uses 2 API in the background (blockchain.info and blockr.io) if one goes down the Gem will makes calls to the other. The data from the API's is chnaged so that they look identical to the caller.
